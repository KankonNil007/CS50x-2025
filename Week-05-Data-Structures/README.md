# 🖥️ Week 5: Data Structures - CS50x 2025

## 🌟 Overview
This folder contains my solutions for Week 5 of Harvard's CS50x 2025 course, focusing on data structures in C programming. Week 5 explores fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and hash tables, emphasizing their implementation and use in solving problems efficiently. These exercises enhance my ability to organize and manipulate data effectively. 🚀

## 🧩 Problem Sets
Below are the problem sets and labs included in this folder, with brief descriptions:

- **Speller**: A program that implements a spell-checker using a hash table or trie to efficiently check the spelling of words in a text file. 📖
- **Lab 5: Inheritance** (if included): A lab exploring data structures through a simulation, such as modeling inheritance or hierarchical relationships using structs. 🧬
- **Additional Exercises** (if included): Likely involve implementing or manipulating data structures like linked lists, trees, or hash tables. Let me know specific files for updates! 😊

## 📚 Learning Objectives
Through these assignments, I aimed to master the following concepts:
- **Data Structures**: Implementing and understanding arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and tries.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimizing data storage and retrieval using appropriate data structures.
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Applying data structures to solve problems like spell-checking or searching efficiently.
- **Dynamic Memory**: Managing memory for custom data structures using `malloc` and `free`.
- **Debugging**: Using tools like `valgrind` and `debug50` to identify memory or logic errors in data structure implementations.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Code
To compile and run the programs:
1. Ensure a C compiler (e.g., `clang`) is installed.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/KankonNil007/CS50x-2025.git`
3. Navigate to the folder: `cd CS50x-2025/Week-05-Data-Structures`
4. Compile a program: `clang program_name.c -o program_name -lcs50`
5. Run it: `./program_name`
6. For programs requiring arguments (e.g., Speller): `./speller dictionary.txt text.txt`

Use CS50 tools like `make` for compilation, `style50` for formatting, and `check50` for testing (e.g., `check50 cs50/problems/2025/x/speller`). 🛠️

## 💭 Reflections
Week 5 was an exciting journey into the world of data structures! 🥳 Building a spell-checker with a hash table or trie was challenging but rewarding, as it showed the power of choosing the right data structure for a problem. Debugging complex pointer-based structures like linked lists or trees deepened my understanding of memory management. These exercises boosted my confidence in designing efficient programs.
