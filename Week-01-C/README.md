# CS50x 2025 - Week 01: C Programming 🚀

## Overview
Welcome to **Week 01** of CS50x 2025! This week, we dive into the world of **C programming**, laying the foundation for computational thinking and problem-solving. From variables and loops to functions and conditionals, we’re starting our coding journey with a bang! 💥

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets and labs for Week 01, where we explore the basics of C and get hands-on with coding in a VS Code environment([cs50.dev](cs50.dev)).

## Problem Sets 📝
Here are the problems tackled this week:
- **Hello**: A simple program to print "hello, world" and get familiar with C syntax.
- **Mario (Less Comfortable)**: Building a half-pyramid of blocks, inspired by Super Mario Bros. 🧱
- **Mario (More Comfortable)**: Creating a full pyramid with two sides, challenging our loop skills.
- **Cash**: Calculating the minimum number of coins needed for change, using greedy algorithms. 💰
- **Credit**: Validating credit card numbers using Luhn’s algorithm. 💳

Each solution is written in C and stored in its respective folder, with comments explaining the logic.

## Learning Objectives 🎯
- Understand the basics of C programming, including variables, data types, and operators.
- Master control structures like loops (`for`, `while`) and conditionals (`if`, `else`).
- Practice problem-solving with algorithms and logical thinking.
- Get comfortable with compiling and running C programs using `make` and `clang`.

## How to Run the Code ⚙️
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or CS50 IDE.
2. Navigate to the specific problem folder (e.g., `cd mario-less`).
3. Compile the program using `make <program-name>`.
4. Run the program with `./<program-name>`.
5. Follow the prompts to input data and see the output!

Example:
```bash
make hello
./hello
```

## Reflections 💭
Week 01 was a thrilling introduction to C! 🖥️ The transition from Scratch to text-based programming was challenging but rewarding. Debugging syntax errors and mastering loops for Mario’s pyramids felt like solving puzzles. The `Cash` and `Credit` problems pushed me to think algorithmically, while the lab introduced real-world applications of coding. I’m excited to build on these skills in Week 02! 🚀
