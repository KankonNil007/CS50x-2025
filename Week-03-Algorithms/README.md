# 🖥️ Week 3: Algorithms - CS50x 2025

## 🌟 Overview
This folder contains my solutions for Week 3 of Harvard's CS50x 2025 course, focusing on algorithms in C programming. Week 3 explores searching and sorting algorithms, as well as algorithmic efficiency using asymptotic notation. These exercises strengthen my ability to design efficient solutions and analyze their performance, preparing me for more advanced data structures. 🚀

## 🧩 Problem Sets
Below are the problem sets and labs included in this folder, with brief descriptions:

- **Plurality**: A program that simulates a plurality election, counting votes for candidates and determining the winner using arrays and sorting techniques. 🗳️
- **Tideman** (if included): A program that implements the Tideman voting system, using sorting and graph algorithms to rank candidates. 🥇
- **Sort**: A lab that implements and compares sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort) to understand their efficiency. 📊
- **Search** (if included): A lab that implements linear and binary search to find elements in arrays efficiently. 🔍

*Note*: If additional problems are included, they likely involve searching or sorting. Let me know specific files for updates! 😊

## 📚 Learning Objectives
Through these assignments, I aimed to master the following concepts:
- **Searching**: Implementing linear search and binary search to locate data efficiently.
- **Sorting**: Applying algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, and merge sort to organize data.
- **Asymptotic Notation**: Understanding Big O (\(O\)), Omega (\(\Omega\)), and Theta (\(\Theta\)) to analyze algorithm efficiency.
- **Algorithm Design**: Creating solutions that balance correctness and performance.
- **Problem-Solving**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable algorithmic steps.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Code
To compile and run the programs:
1. Ensure a C compiler (e.g., `clang`) is installed.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/KankonNil007/CS50x-2025.git`
3. Navigate to the folder: `cd CS50x-2025/Week-03-Algorithms`
4. Compile a program: `clang program_name.c -o program_name -lcs50`
5. Run it: `./output/program_name`
6. For programs requiring arguments (e.g., Plurality): `./plurality Alice Bob Charlie`

Use CS50 tools like `make` for compilation, `style50` for formatting, and `check50` for testing (e.g., `check50 cs50/problems/2025/x/plurality`). 🛠️

## 💭 Reflections
Week 3 was an exciting dive into algorithms! 🥳 Grasping the differences between linear and binary search clarified the importance of data organization. Implementing sorting algorithms like merge sort was challenging but rewarding, especially when visualizing their efficiency. The Tideman problem (if included) pushed my understanding of complex logic and edge cases. Debugging with `debug50` helped me refine my solutions, and I now appreciate how algorithmic efficiency impacts real-world programs.
